Setup Instructions:
AngularJS Client can be launched from the client's app root folder (AngularJSClient) by using the command 'http-server'. If you would like to know more about the light weight 'http-server' just head here: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server" target="_blank"> https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server </a>

ASP.NET Core Web API can be launched using Visual Studio 2015 with the latest version of the ASP.NET Core tools installed. Just open the solution file to load the project and launch Debug (IIS Express) from the Visual Studio IDE
